      <h3>American Red Cross</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.flat.com" target="_blank">Flat</a> * 2006</h4>
      <p>
        Five years after the devastating 9/11 attacks, America was still steeped in the aftereffects of the catastrophic events: residual medical ailments, missing family members, and PTSD were just a few of the persistent problems. The American Red Cross had built the 9/11 Legacy Fund to provide assistance for these problems, however most of the public was unaware of what purpose, and to what extent, it served.

      <p>
        How do you rebrand one of the world's largest and oldest construction companies? Concentrate on the particulates: the people who make up the whole. As Design Lead at Third &amp; Grove, I provided user experience and interface design, devOps assistance, and QA for the responsive-minded redesign and development of a people-focused web experience.

      <p>
        Gone are the old-fashioned days of science and tech being a "man's" world. Thank goddess there are brilliant, creative minds like Aleks Bogunovic and her fine-arts-fueled soft goods consulting and fabrication company. I provided a one-on-one, modernized design and development rebuild of her marketing website, optimizing for search engines and a responsive experience.

        As creative consultant and art director for Swedish News – with more than 150k subscribers via two major editorial outlets (Nordic Reach, Nordstjernan) – I did not choose to become obsessed with Swedish culture… it chose me.

      <h4>2014</h4>
      <p>
        What do economics, artists, gutterpunks, and river rats have in common? Nothing. However, everyone needs to pay taxes, and to get a business loan, you need accounting. With Katie Bowie, owner of Bowie & Co, I provided a rebranding of her identity, copywriting, and an entirely new online presence for their creative, unique, and arts-industry-focused approach to providing accounting and tax consulting to all.

      <p>
        Levine was tasked with rebranding BBYO (B'nai B'rith Youth Organization) revitalizing for the millenial market by updating an identity system and presence that was over 90 years old. I served as the Senior Designer, providing design and production for the secret booklets all members receive, the summer events booklet, several illustrations, as well as design and UX consulting for three of their website venues

      <h4><a href="https://www.3pcmedia.com" target="_blank">3PC Media</a> * 2012</h4>
      <p>
        With functionality such as an informative, 3D interactive molecule elaborating on the key research areas of Lanxess, as well as an age-bracketed survey, I developed a pitch document and creative comps for what the app could be. Thanks to a great design team as support, the pitch went well. Unfortunately, I parted ways before the project was finalized, and word is the app sunk before leaving shore.

        This is the project every graphic designer dreams of: design a book on the history of books. With Levine's Design Manager, Monica Snelling, and a Library of Congress curator, Levon Avdoyan, we composed one of the most beautiful books I've had the pleasure of working on.

        Communities in School is a network of education professionals striving to match students up with community support and empowerment in order to keep them in school and on track.
